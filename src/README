The src/ directory (except for the platform/ subdirectory) contains
platform-independent code for the package manager. All code in this
directory (and its other subdirectories) is written using UTF-8 encoding;
a platform-specific loader from the boot directory translates Unicode
to the target APL's native character set during loading.

The boot loader loads only the src/LOADER.apl file, which in turn uses
the pkg‚çôBOOT_LOAD function to load additional files from the src-*/
directories.

The src/os/ directory contains a subdirectory for each supported host
platform. The LOADER.apl file loads platform-specific files from the
appropriate subdirectory based upon a load-time determination of the
platform identities.
