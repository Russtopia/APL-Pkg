The src/platform/ directory contains platform-specific code for the
package manager. All code in this directory (and its subdirectories)
is written using UTF-8 encoding; a platform-specific loader from the
boot directory translates Unicode to the target APL's native character
set during loading.

The boot loader loads only the src/LOADER.apl file, which in turn uses
the pkg‚çôBOOT_LOAD function to load additional files from the src-*/
directories.

The src/platform/ directory contains a subdirectory for each supported
APL platform. The LOADER.apl file loads platform-specific files from
the appropriate src/platform/ subdirectory based upon a load-time
determination of the platform identity. See the package manager's API
documentation for functions to be used for load-time platform detection
and selection of alternative execution paths.
