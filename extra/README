The `extra` directory contains files which complement the use of `apl-pkg`.

akt

  This C program maps keyboard sequences ESC-<key> to APL characters and
  passes all other key sequences unchanged. Provisions are made to pass
  ESC without a following key and to pass ANSI keycodes beginning with a
  CSI (ESC-[); these provisions are based upon a timer.

  You must use akt with a terminal emulator which is configured to "Send
  Meta as Escape". This is the default for most modern terminal emulators.

  The program is designed to pipe its output to another process, such as
  an APL interpreter or a text editor. When connected via a pipe, the
  program's default behavior in response to typing Ctrl-C is to send a
  SIGINT to the process on the receiving end of the pipe. (This facility
  requires Linux.) The receiving process may either trap the signal or
  terminate; in the latter case, akt will detect the termination and exit.

  The akt program provides a keyboard layout based upon Dyalog's keyboard.
  You type APL characters by holding the Alt or Shift+Alt keys.

  Because Alt+` often conflicts with window-manager key bindings, the APL ◊
  is also available via Alt+D (note: uppercase d; the Shift key must be
  pressed along with the Alt key).

  The akt 1.3 (and later) layout adds symbols for currency and for GNU APL:

    Alt+Y ¥      Alt+W ⍹
    Alt+U €      Alt+A ⍶
    Alt+C ¢      Alt+X χ
    Alt+B £

  You must have a C compiler installed to build akt. The apl-pkg installer
  attempts to build akt and creates a link to the program in ~/bin.

  Run $ akt -h for further details.

keyboard1.txt

  This file illustrates the keyboard layout implemented by akt. You may
  print it for reference.

  This file can be made available to GNU APL's ]KEYB command by adding a
  line to your ~/.gnu-apl/preferences file:

  KEYBOARD_LAYOUT_FILE /absolute/path/to/keyboard1.txt

awe

  This script runs akt and GNU APL, loading apl-pkg and a system manifest
  file at startup. The apl-pkg installer creates a link to the awe script
  in ~/bin, creating the directory if it does not exist.

  Run $ awe -h for further details.

  Note that awe requires akt.

  You may run awe in the console; it will, if needed, install the console
  APL font. To restore the original font after exiting awe, it may be
  necessary to type one ^D.
