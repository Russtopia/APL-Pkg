- Loader should be selective about ]-commands; allow only user-command
  definition (e.g. ]usercmd in GNU APL).

- Loader should disallow system commands in ⍎ argument, e.g. ⍎')off'.

- Finish APLwrap integration (complete with incomplete context).

- Deployment scenario: stripped-down package manager (loader and
  dependencies only?) plus additional command-line option
  `--pkg-repository` allows distribution of deployable system as an
  archive containing packages and manifest. System is then loaded as
  `$ apl -- --pkg-repository <path> --pkg-manifest <manifest>`.
