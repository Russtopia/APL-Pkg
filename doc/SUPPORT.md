Support Status
==============

Please refer APL Package Manager support inquiries to the `bug-apl`
mailing list. I shall strive to support the APL Package Manager and its
interactions with CLI tools as time permits.

Be advised that I now do all of my work in a CLI environment and am
unable to answer configuration inquiries regarding, for example,
`GNOME`-based applications.

Also, after over three decades of being an `Emacs` user (I started using
`Emacs` at right around the time its code base was transitioning from
TECO to C), I've switched to a `vi`-like editor (see `docs/VIS.md`).
The `Emacs`-specific code in the APL Package Manager is unlikely to
require support; nevertheless, I will be unable to answer most inquiries
regarding the use of `Emacs` in combination with the package manager.
Please see `docs/EMACS.md`.

I participated in the development of `APLwrap`, a nice GUI shell for
`GNU APL` written by Chris Moller. `APLwrap`, when used with the APL
Package Manager, supports a number of nice features including tab
completion of package manager commands. I shall strive to keep 
completions up-to-date in the package manager; no changes are required
in `APLwrap`. To the best of my knowledge, `APLwrap` is no longer
actively developed. Because I am no longer working in a GUI environment,
I am unable to answer questions regarding the use of `APLwrap`.
