The release name appears as the value of `pkgâˆ†manager` when the
package manager is loaded.

The version is the first release version of the series having the
indicated features. The version is in the package manager's metadata
as `package_version`.

The audience for the package manager is defined as the combination of
four factors:

1. **# D**: Number of Developers - where a developer is a programmer
   creating and using packages.
2. **# O**: Number of Organizations - where an organization is a
   collection of developers working in close conjunction. An
   organization is not necessarily physically colocated.
3. **# C**: Number of Communities - where a community is a collection
   of developers and organization focused on the shared development
   of a package.
4. **# P**: Number of Platforms - where a platform is a combination of
   host environment and APL environment.

The anticipated coordination style is one of:

1. **local** - Developers are in close contact with one another (not
   necessarily physically colocated) to ensure interoperability among
   packages.
2. **manual** - Developers have a bit more independence as the
   platform manager evolves to provide tools to mitigate some of the
   close coordination needed to ensure interoperability among
   packages.
3. **distributed** - The now-mature package manager supports fully
   distributed collaboration with a minimum of tedious housekeeping.
