About APLwrap
=============

*I no longer actively support APLwrap. Patches are welcomed.*

APLwrap, written by Chris Moller with contributions from me,
is a GTK+ shell in which to run GNU APL. APLwrap provides

- a GNU APL keyboard binding
- an APL font
- editor windows for functions and files
- integration with Chris's aplplot package
- integration with APL Package Manager's completion facility

See [aplwrap](https://github.com/ChrisMoller/aplwrap) and
[aplplot](https://github.com/ChrisMoller/aplplot).
