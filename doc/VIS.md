The vis editor
==============

`vis` is a lightweight vi-like editor written by Marc Andr√© Tanner
and contributors. Source code is available on GitHub. While `vis` is
included in some Linux distributions, it is being actively developed;
I strongly recommend building from source.

`vis` should be thought of as a dialect of `vi`, in the same sense
as `vim` but without all the extra built-in features. `vis` has a
relatively shallow learning curve.

`vis` (after version 0.6, including the GitHub version) has syntax
coloring for APL files.
