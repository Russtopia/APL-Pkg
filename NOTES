To be completed:

	- Rework directory-path mapping to handle versioned packages.

	- Evaluate constraints.
        - Select constrained versions.

--- current

pkg⍙get_load_paths calls pkg⍙compute_dependencies, which computes
all dependencies for a package.

pkg⍙load calls pkg⍙get_load_paths and pkg⍙load_one_package.

pkg⍙get_load_paths returns all required packages regardless of version.

pkg⍙load checks versions present for consistent definition and
non-duplication.

--- pending

pkg⍙load will compute the set of packages which satisfy version
constraints.

	compute dependency graph
	use backtracking search to find set of satisfying versions
	load as usual

How does pkg⍙load receive per-package version constraints? (via
pkg⍙get_load_paths?)
